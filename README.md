# Dice Game

## description

I have created a dice game that is designed to be fun for the user. 
It uses 6 sided dice, 10 sided dice and 20 sided dice.
The aim is to get the highest dice roll and be the first to win 10 times and beat the computer. 

My layout is simple, all the player needs to do is select a die and press the roll button. Once the game is over just press restart to try again. 

I decided to make a dice game because I am an avid D&D player and love rolling dice!

## Technologies used

I used HTML, css and Javascript to create this game. i used thses technologies because my game is designed to run on web browsers on many devices and the vast majority of web browsers have intergrated HTML, css and javascript. 

## Bugs

One major bug I faced (image below) was a space created by a line that would not allow me to display divs side-by-side. I tried displaying the divs using inline-flex which worked with every other div wrapper but would not work with the all-rolls-wrapper. Unfortunately the only way I found to fix this was by nesting the all-rolls-wrapper in another div. I will work to fix this using the correct css in future updates.

## Testing

I tested the game myself, hundreds of times over the course of it's creation and also had a group of 10 people test the game repeatedly. No sereous issues were reported throughout all of my and the groups testing. 

## Validating

I ran the site through W3C HTML and css validators and both reported no errors as seen below.

I also ran the site using Lighthouse and had no problems. The results can be seen below.  

## Publishing 

The website was published and hosted from Github, using Github pages on 01/04/2022.

## Layout

The user is first taken to the start menu where they can select what die they want to use.
